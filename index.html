Hi! My name is Ozan Teo Sarac, and this is my website! The design is someone else's while I try to write out the relevant info. I'm double majoring in Economics & Computer Science at 
<a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm the president of the Economics Society, an actor in <a href="https://midnightproductions.org/">Midnight Productions</a>, and active in various other clubs. 
</p>

<p>
I was born in 2004 in Ankara, Turkey. I've lived in Ankara, Marseille, St. Petersburg, Chicago, Canberra and now reside full-time in Williamstown, MA as Housing Coordinator of <a href="https://facilities.williams.edu/properties/fayerweather/">Fayerweather Hall</a>.
